## Quick Introduction
This is my capstone project for the [Google Data Analytics Professional certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics#courses). For this project, I chose "Case Study 3," where I had the opportunity to build my own case study instead of working with one of the two pre-designed options. I mainly used Visual Studio Code for querying, PostgreSQL for database management, and Google Sheets for visualizations.

## Topic
I chose the [TED Talk](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/ted-talks) dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for my project . This dataset contains information about various TED Talks, including details like the speaker, duration, views, and categories of the talks. The problem I will be exploring is identifying which topics are most effective at attracting viewers, which speakers are best suited for gaining viewership, and analyzing other factors that contribute to a TED Talk's popularity. My chosen metrics will help assess the impact of different speakers and topics on viewer engagement, the following metrics have been chosen:  
- The following metrics have been chosen, but not limited to:
    - Total viewership in areas such as yearly views
    - "Relative speaker value"
    - Speaker views
    - Monthly views

## Other Topic Information
**_1: Who are the stakeholders?_** <br> 
**_2: Who is your audience?_** <br> 
**_3: How can your insights help your client make decisions?_** <br> 
- 1: My stakeholders are the upper levels of TED, including event planners.
- 2: My audience includes both the event planners/upper levels of TED and the viewers themselves, as I aim to provide more of what the audience wants to see.
- 3: My insights will identify the ideal speakers, topics, timing for events, and more!

## Data
The data for this project will primarily come from CSV files, they can be found [HERE](https://github.com/JoshuaYerdon/Ted-Talk-Capstone/tree/main/SVC%20Files) or in this project's repository.The data has been slightly modified into two CSV files, labeled "ted_talks_stats" and "ted_talks," as I wanted multiple tables for my database rather than just one. I have included a copy of the original if anyone would like to look at it, labeled "ted_talks_original". This dataset has a 10/10 usability score from Kaggle, which indicates it is highly credible and usable.
